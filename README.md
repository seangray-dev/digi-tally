# DigiTally - web3 Counter App

[DigitTally](https://digi-tally.vercel.app/) demonstrates a simple interaction with the blockchain using [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/). It allows users to increment or decrement a counter stored on the blockchain, showcasing the basics of smart contract interactions within a React application.

## Features

- Blockchain Integration on Sepolia Test Network: Leverages thirdweb to engage with our smart contract deployed on the Sepolia test network.
- Increment/Decrement Counter: Users can modify the counter value stored on the blockchain.
- Wallet Connection: Integrates with users' wallets for seamless blockchain interactions.

## Connecting Your Wallet

- Initiate a wallet connection in the app by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button.
- A prompt will request permission to connect to the app.
- After connection, you can increment or decrement the counter using the "+" and "-" buttons.

## Interacting with the Counter

To interact with the app on the Sepolia test network, users will need Sepolia ETH in their wallets. Sepolia ETH can be obtained from Sepolia testnet faucets, which are online services that distribute free test ETH for development and testing purposes.

### Obtaining Sepolia ETH

To perform transactions on the Sepolia test network within [DigiTally](https://digi-tally.vercel.app/), you'll need Sepolia ETH, which has no real-world value but is necessary for executing transactions on the testnet. You can acquire Sepolia ETH from the following sources:
